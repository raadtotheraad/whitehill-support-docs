To import your file, simply drag the product file into Roblox Studio once your game is fully loaded. 
Alternatively, you can use the Explorer context menu by right-clicking and selecting **Insert > Insert From File**.

=== 2. Placement & Positioning.
You are free to move, rotate and scale the ATM models to your liking, although make sure they're all located within the `JSM | ATM V3` **->** `Terminals` folder.

!!!info
Any misplaced models **will not** work, keeping them in their respective folders is required.

=== 3. Configure your Freestyle.
While the ATM terminals are designed to work immediately, we recommend reviewing the configuration module found under `JSM | ATM V3` **->** `SystemConfig` to perfect your experience.
